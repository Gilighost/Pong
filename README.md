# Pong

Bounce a ball around some walls in this exciting new game.
Known bugs: Game will sometimes not stay in "mouse" mode, reveting back to keyboard controls.
Not sure why this happens, it is difficult to make it happen regularly.
Cameron LaFerney: Animated sprite sheet, reflection collisions, images and sounds, pause screen 55%
Sam Hipp: middle obstacle (and its sound), resizing + beautification, game over conditions, fixed collision bugs, mouse controls 45%
